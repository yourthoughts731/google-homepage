Hi, my name is Rene Romero.

I started Odin Project last September and Im practicing my skills in github, learn the basics and master it.
Today is October 20, 2020 Tuesday!!!

Please guide me until I have the skills to get a formal project. 

I am pleased to help me by contacting me at my Facebook Page @HHext Gaming.

Lets do this together!!!

Thank You!!
